EsetBotWarz AI controller - turn towards the nearest enemy

The ESET BotWarz is an online event where teams of virtual robots fight each other in an online arena. There's a framework that allows bot AIs to be written in Lua: https://github.com/madmaxoft/EsetBotWarz

This little project aims to implement one of the simplest AIs for the game. Each bot turns to face the nearest enemy, thus trying to avoid being hit in the vulnerable sides or back.
